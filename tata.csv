2024-11-29 04:58:54,If only tata can better their after sale service
2024-11-29 04:52:11,"https://preview.redd.it/qo72fcycur3e1.jpeg?width=663&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c2c977e234f14ad8fc708fda5bdc9670e880e6b

This sub and Tata Motors."
2024-11-29 04:37:05,"I really resonate with the idea of Tata Motors being a sleeper stock. Companies that think big while staying grounded in their strengths tend to win in the long run. Tata Motors might not have Tesla‚Äôs hype, but they‚Äôve got solid fundamentals and a market that‚Äôs just starting to heat up. Definitely feels like a gem for patient investors!"
2024-11-29 04:00:13,"And most likely it‚Äôs going only down from here unless they somehow manage to bring low end EV prices close to CNG cars with bigger range. 

Mahindra is putting out ‚Äúcrazy value for money‚Äù car after car but they play in 15L plus segment mostly. 

The problem for Tata is Suzuki has just put out a car with 5 star safety rating. Tata‚Äôs quality control is literally shit compared to Suzuki and other Japanese. Just safety is not going to sell any more cars for them. 

Next year Suzuki is coming out with their first EV. Koreans already have world class EVs in international markets. They just need to figure out the budget EV part. 

So unless we don‚Äôt see ground breaking improvements in Tata‚Äôs quality control it‚Äôs doomed in longer run."
2024-11-29 03:51:32,"Exactly came here to post this. There are many factors that are likely to drag it down in short term. 

- Late woke campaign for JLR, backfiring badly
- Decision to go all electric for established Jaguar 
- Very bad support infra for Indian EVs post sales
- Horrible and entitled dealer network

These issues have to be addressed before any reliable rally can be seen. 

PS: I am a Tata car owner and have positions in Tata Motors üôÇ"
2024-11-29 03:39:42,"Just look at Tata EV market share trend over the past 2 years. They had high initial market share because of first mover advantage. Now that it's gone. Don't be shocked if it falls below 50% by end of next year. And have you seen the BE 6E? Like tell me why would one buy a Curvv over this?

Now coming to Jaguar, Good lord it was a disastrous rebrand. Aston Martin, Lotus, Mercedes etc. Have all reversed their electrification plan. But Jag is still sticking to it and also removed all their logos."
2024-11-29 03:31:38,Not a day goes by without Tata motors post
2024-11-29 03:14:57,"Recently Mahnindra overtook Tata in no of cars sold securing the third rank. While people saying India‚Äôs economy will boom, there is definitely going to be a period of stagflation in the economy. Another aspect is huge inventories of cars are with dealers and they are giving discounts because of it. Also ev‚Äôs are not the profit making segment for Tata, in fact they are loss making. In Germany also due to economic slowdown, big players like Volkswagen, Audi, BMW and even Mercedes have seen declining sales, especially electric vehicles segment."
2024-11-29 03:04:18,"Tata Motors and Tesla - not in same league by any stretch of imagination. 

Tesla is pursuing innovation and betting big on FSD, Robotaxi and robotics. 
Tata is pure play manufacturer who keeps rehashing available tech. Common point between two - both are selling cars which are battery powered EVs. 

I have driven Nexon and Tesla. They are not comparable in driving fun, automation or customer experience. Tesla is way superior and in diff league. 

Do you think if Tata will be able to sustain its market share in face of recently launched Mahindra BE 6e or planned Hyundai India built EVs?

BYD will sweep the market share unless government steps in to protect Indian players. 

So Tata Motors is in precarious position in Indian market. 

JLR is doing good but any views and upside  expectations based on Nexon is flawed IMO."
2024-11-29 03:00:54,I disagree! JLR did what others did with DEI shit! It‚Äôs gonna go down the savage way! Tata motors here not improving the services and lately that has been reflecting in the sales contraction. So they are shooting their own feet!
2024-11-29 02:56:00,"One question: would it change your perception in the context that only 11% of tata motors revenue is from passenger segment, with a huge market share already in electric. say even if this segment grows by 25%, that will translate to an impact of <3% on its overall revenue.
it is hugely dependent on JLR growth. your decision to invest in tatamtr should be based on that rather than passenger segment.
im no expert, though."
2024-11-29 02:27:41,"I also saw about Tata Motors‚Äô demerger plans, and I think it‚Äôs a smart move. Splitting its passenger, commercial, and EV businesses could really unlock value. It lets each segment focus on growth and efficiency, plus it might attract more targeted investors. Feels like this could boost their market valuation over time"
2024-11-29 02:25:01,"If you want to make a saving, then Tata Motors is the stock to tend to. Just don't see the minor fluctuations today. Invest and forget about it."
2024-11-29 02:22:46,"Also i found this today

Vedanta, Tata Motors among 9 companies that announced demerger plans


Would this help us?"
2024-11-29 02:22:29,"To b frank
I added more just couple of days before Sir Ratan tata passed away
And i discussed it with a fellow Redditor that if sir passes away 
What would happen to Tata group

He said trust Tata"
2024-11-28 22:57:49,"JLR Owned by tata has 2 brands land rover which is doing great and jaguar which is going to be luxurious electric car , the December premier will tell if it is a sucess or failure the advertisement was just a marketing stunt , tata has good ev making capabilites and design."
2024-11-28 19:28:00,"It seems like that and charts also shows same !
But Automotive market in India is going to boom in few years due to EV revolution and there are very few prominent players , one of them is Tata"
2024-11-28 18:18:44,"So, think about how someone might need to curb India's growth trajectory: by striking where it hurts most‚Äîcompanies like Adani, Reliance, Tata, Birla, Infosys, and TCS. Why do we need Adani? Well, we need infrastructure, ports, technology, etc. Where will all this come from? Can the government simply print money and give it to people? No, we need corporations, investment, skill sets, etc. This often involves crony capitalism.

Has this happened elsewhere? Yes, post-American Civil War, a few business houses like Rockefeller and Vanderbilt controlled much of the economy.

Connect the dots: Why is there a sudden uprising in Bangladesh? Perhaps because Western powers are unhappy with India's rise. When India starts buying Russian oil and disregards U.S. foreign policy, it becomes a target for restraint.

SEC wont even exists under Trump.

If you believe in Indian story then Invest."
2024-11-28 16:47:50,"In the March quarter, Tata Motors had a deferred tax income of 9,480 crore. That's why March quarter profits are much higher than usual, therefore PE ratio is so low. Its actual PE ratio would be in the mid 20s."
2024-11-28 15:34:33,"Yeah ofcourse. Sales declining, profits declining. Global sales on jlr showing no sign of recovery. But yeah, I'm ""active"" and have ""skills to make funny lines"". And I'm sure tata motors will be 2000 in 2025."
2024-11-28 15:10:09,"If the Tatas are going down, Its because their management didn't have their ears on the ground and elevated employees who will erode their brand value to decision making levels. the whole JLR rebranding reeks of decisions taken by people who go by instagram and reddit trends instead of ground realities. Imagine sinking the value of  Jaguar. The Tatas also love hiring managers. I am sure they have more managers in the QC team instead of testers. 

Their passenger car segment has been bailed out by the commercial segment and TCS revenue for too long. Shareholders should demand for the company to be to take action against non performing leaders before the passenger car segment's decision taking team spreads its rot to the commercial segment as well."
2024-11-28 15:03:03,Tata bye bye khatam
2024-11-28 13:25:41,"Here‚Äôs a hint for you - Tata Motors‚Äô management has forecast a 5% decline in earnings per share (EPS) for FY26, adjusting estimates downward due to anticipated challenges in both the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) segment and the domestic market. This adjustment follows a 3% reduction in EPS estimates for FY25, reflecting concerns over stagnant margins and moderating demand in key sectors

Here‚Äôs another hint for you - Tata Motors has significant share of international revenue. VW Group PE is sub 4; Toyota PE is 8. Do you still feel it trades at a discount to peers? 

Why would you be bullish on a counter where the management itself isn‚Äôt?"
2024-11-28 12:52:33,"No nothing like that, Tata is very strong fundamentally"
2024-11-28 12:44:22,TATA QC is just plain awful. I wouldn‚Äôt take a TATA car even if they gave it away for free.
2024-11-28 12:26:28,The fact that if you buy a top end Harrier worth 26L and there is no guarantee that itl be niggle free is insane. I am still surprised how Tata is still in the business.
2024-11-28 11:55:37,"Many of the algo are based on technical analysis. 
Most of the hni follow it. 
Most of the retailers with little bit of knowledge follow it. 

Since everyone follow it, even if it's not scientific, it becomes true. 

For long term, it doesn't matter. 

Take an example, 
Tatamotors is falling and 90 percent people believe that there is strong support at previous reversal level at around 650.

Now most of the people with either wait for that level to reach before buying or they will place amo order at that level. 

So even if tata motors fundamental are weaker and true value below 650, buying will be triggered at 650.
FOMO due to reversal will create another buying wave. 

People who wait for 25 rise after will reversal will again create buying wave and cycle will continue. 

Hence technical analysis will become true on chart. 


Always remember what we are buying and purchasing is just the perceived price decided by the masses. Actual intrinsic value doesn't decide stock value, it just help to decide long term trend of the stock."
2024-11-28 10:23:03,"Uphill stuff:

a) It will become net debt zero by FY 2025.

b) PE is very low compared to the industry PE

c) ethical and robust management with great expertize in automobile sector.

d) along with TATA elxsi, TATA tech and TATA Power they are building a robust ecosystem for Electric Vehicle. TaMo is already 1st mover in EV

e) Its TATA :)."
2024-11-28 10:22:17,"Yup, Tata motors and Ashok Leyland both tend to be cyclical at times."
2024-11-28 10:13:18,"Dude, just minutes before, I wrote to Tata motors investor relations, regarding this ad, asking for a management change in jaguar, with 9 shares. ü§£"
2024-11-28 09:55:36,"Luxon Tata does it only in a small region of India, mostly in Kerala. Tata needs something similar at least in all major cities of India, to give better experience to at least a good share of customers. Do the same like Luxon in other places, esp where people complain that the service is pathetic."
2024-11-28 09:47:39,But Luxon Tata is already doing it for Tata...
2024-11-28 09:46:06,From Nippon group (which does it for Toyota) [https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/indian-car-dealerships/257747-nippon-group-toyota-fame-start-new-tata-service-centers-kerala.html](https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/indian-car-dealerships/257747-nippon-group-toyota-fame-start-new-tata-service-centers-kerala.html)

Luxon Tata is a Tata dealer in Kerala and already services Tata vehicles in their service centres."
2024-11-28 09:32:55,khatam gaya tata bye goodbye
2024-11-28 08:41:15,"Accumulating tata power below and around 400, 10 years horizon.

Staying away from motors and steel."
2024-11-28 08:25:55,"By Toyota, I meant the companies such as Luxon Tata, which is from the Nippon group which does it for Toyota. And they have been good.

Toyota has nothing to gain from it."
2024-11-28 08:25:11,"Yeah its been a while that TATA is down. I'm holding this stock. Will wait for November sales numbers and decide if I need to sell. 
Competition has definitely increased. Nexon And Punch were ruling the cSUV sales list earlier this year but have been overtaken now."
